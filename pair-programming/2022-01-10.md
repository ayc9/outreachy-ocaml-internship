_Monday call with Shon; went over [`make` implementation](https://github.com/ayc9/standard_derivers/tree/make), step by step._

This call served as a review of the work on `make`. We went line by line through the implementation file, as well as the newly added or updated tests. As various points, we paused to reason about the code, discuss OCaml syntax or semantics and comment on possible changes to improve readability. [This commit](https://github.com/ayc9/standard_derivers/commit/972692d3aa19e34b068d7794c31798929fe9c44f) is the result of the session, and it includes:
- Merging three helper modules: the functions in the `Inspect` and `Create` modules were moved to the `Construct` module (originally called module `A`)
- Simplifying the steps in the structure and signature derivations; in particular, refactoring the `match with` check for `private` types from a separate `record` function into a more clearly named `check_public` function, which simplifies the `derive_per_td` function that calls it. Check around line 80 in the commit linked above.
- Tests file structure: we also (unsuccessfully) tried to change the file structure of the cram tests to prevent duplication of the tests' `dune` and `.ml` files.
